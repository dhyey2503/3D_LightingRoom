ðŸ’¡ 3DLightingRoom â€“ Advanced Interactive 3D Lighting Environment

"3DLightingRoom" is a cutting-edge, browser-based 3D lighting simulation tool built with **React.js** and **Three.js** (via **React Three Fiber**). It enables users to visualize, place, and configure lighting setups within a customizable virtual room in real-time.

This project merges the power of WebGL, real-time graphics, and intuitive UI/UX design to offer an immersive lighting design experience. From ambient glow to dynamic spotlights, every lighting element is fully interactive and visually accurateâ€”making it a great base for architectural previews, virtual showrooms, interior design mockups, or educational simulations.

 ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to provide a platform where users can experiment with different lighting types and behaviors in a realistic 3D environment. The application simulates how light interacts with surfaces, mimicking real-world behaviors such as casting shadows, changing intensity, and bouncing light.
